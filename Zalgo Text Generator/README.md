# Zalgo Text Generator

This is a bigger project made but also in the span of one day.
It's idea is that you most likely have encountered such things as "glitch texts" online. Super scary, super pupper scoopy. The idea was to make a generator just like that with python and throw everything into a GUI made with Tkinter, so you would not have to constantly work with a command promt, adjust 5-6 different parameters, but do it very conveniently in a GUI window.

What is this Zalgo text? Well here you go: Z̢̰̯̙̜̎ͯͣ̍͊à͕̹̞̜̭͈͛ͥ̊̔̆̔l͇ͮͦ̒͊͒ͦͤg̛͕͖̟̮̪ͥͯ̿͆ỏ̠͎͇̀̎̅ ̬̭͖̯̐̎͒̉t͚̘̤͢e̩̳̣x͕͍̗̘̅̑̑t̯̮͍͗̋ͮ̍ͪ ̧̗͆̑ͫͮ̐ͯe͚̤̩̖̻͕ͅx͓͉̤͈̘̭͈͑ͪ͆̎ͨă̙̻̬͝m̥̔ͪ̊ͧ͂͋ͣp̣̰̦̲̩̐ͤͫ̒͜lͤ̔͝e͕͛̾ͪ͗͂͛. This one particularly was made with Zalgo Text Generator by Tchouky: http://www.eeemo.net. 

My example looks like this with somewhat similar pre-sets: Zà̴̡̜̳̹͛̐ͬl̸̳̺͈̊́̌̕͘g̛̼̠̭̐ͨͯ͠͡o̸̸͙͖̱̿̄̃͞ ̷̴̼͚̭̀ͣ̊͞t̴̸̮̥͓̀ͪ́ͩe̡̮̭̞ͩ̈̊̕͝x̡̠̞̜̓͌ͨ͝͞t̢̨͈͈͓́̋̑͟ ͏̛͏͕͓̮̄̔̽ę̶̧͍̦̭ͨ̎ͥx̧̥̬̪͊̉͗̕͠á̢̧͖̞̥͂̌͗m͏͓̟̙͑̎ͦ͘͞p̢̛̞̗̳̉̆͋͠ľ̨̥̦̲͊̑̕͜è̛̬̥̘ͮ͑̉͢. 

To explain how it works as I understand: there are additional symbols that do not count as extra spaces. Meaning they can be applied on top of other text or each other. Usually they would be used to make adjustments to letters. Example s -> š. But we are increasing the insanity by applying them multiple times. Because they also do not take extra space, most chats, forums, and text editors see them and read, but because they do not take extra space (on the page, not in storage) they overlay any text they come in contact with. With extremes the text can be overlayed quite substantially. For more examples see the examples file.

Letters that I got I have used from the repository of MetroWind's project (from Github). https://gist.github.com/MetroWind/1401473/4631da7a4540a63e72701792a4aa0262acc7d397 Giving credit where credit is due. But I believe they are the same symbols as we saw on Zalgo Text Generator by Tchouky: http://www.eeemo.net. My life was just a lot easier searching for them.

This repository holds

> Screenshots of the GUI
> Initial file in .ipynb format where I experimented with this methodology
> .py file that holds all of the code to run that also starts the GUI
> .bat file that you can place into your folder to start the .py file automatically.
