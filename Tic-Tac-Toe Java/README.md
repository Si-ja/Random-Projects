### Tic-Tac-Toe with Java

While getting into Java I revisited an old project idea of Tic-Tac-Toe.

This version was written in a relativelly simple manner and can be played in the cmd/terminal in the following modes:

* Players vs Player
* Player vs Computer:
> Easy mode - Player Starts and computer is fully random
> Medium mode - Computer Starts and is fully random
> Hard mode - Computer Starts and plays by a certain solid strategy

Just compile it and play.
`javac TheGame.java

java TheGame`

Enjoy.
Regarding Licenses:
Was made for fun, so use it for fun, not commercial purposes...though with this quality, let's be fair, who will buy it.
