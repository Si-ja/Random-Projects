The pirates, the coconuts and the monkey problem.
Python based solution, but not finished due to errors with when there is only 1 pirate.

def pirates(crew):
    coconuts = 1
    pile = coconuts
    i = 0
    while i < crew+1:
        if pile%crew == 1:
            pile = int((1/crew * (crew-1))*(pile-1))
            i += 1
        else:
            coconuts += 1
            i = 0
            pile = coconuts
            continue
    print(coconuts)
