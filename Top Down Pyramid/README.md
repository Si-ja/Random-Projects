# Printing of a Pyramid - top down.

A small code in R showing how to print a top down view of a Pyramid, where the smallest value is the top of it and largest are the building foundation.

With something like 5 layers the pyramid would look the following way:

```
      [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] [,6] [,7] [,8] [,9]
 [1,]    5    5    5    5    5    5    5    5    5
 [2,]    5    4    4    4    4    4    4    4    5
 [3,]    5    4    3    3    3    3    3    4    5
 [4,]    5    4    3    2    2    2    3    4    5
 [5,]    5    4    3    2    1    2    3    4    5
 [6,]    5    4    3    2    2    2    3    4    5
 [7,]    5    4    3    3    3    3    3    4    5
 [8,]    5    4    4    4    4    4    4    4    5
 [9,]    5    5    5    5    5    5    5    5    5
 ```
